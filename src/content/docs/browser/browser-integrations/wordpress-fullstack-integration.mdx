Instrument and monitor your Wordpress application with the New Relic agents. Analyze your performance data (errors, page load time, user traffic, and page views) in view for the best code diagnosis, improvement, and optimization.

After setting up our Wordpress integration, we give you a dashboard for your Wordpress metrics.

### Step 1 (optional): Install the infrastructure agent [#infra-install]

Installing the infrastructure agent is optional, but doing this will get you important metrics about the host where your app is running. 

To do this, follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent).

### Step 2: Install PHP agent

Open [PHP quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/php).
Click on install button to start the php agent installation.

### Step 3: NRI-Flex Configuration

Once you've installed the infrastructure agent on your host, nri-flex binary is also installed with it.

To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

1.  Create a file named `read-wordpress-files-config.yml` in this path:

  ```shell
  /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
  ```

2.  Update the `read-wordpress-files-config.yml` with the below details.

    *   INSERT_EVENT_TYPE: You can consider `event_type` as a New Relic database table that you can query using NRQL (for example, WPDirectories).
    *   INSERT_WORDPRESS_PATH: It takes the directory of the Wordpress application (for example, /srv/www/wordpress/*).

3.  Use the below configuration file:

  ```
  integrations:
    - name: nri-flex
      interval: 180s
      config:
        name: linuxDirectorySize
        apis:
        - event_type: INSERT_EVENT_TYPE
          commands:
            - run: du INSERT_WORDPRESS_PATH
              split: horizontal
              set_header: [dirSizeKB, dirName]
              regex_match: true
              split_by: (\d+)\s+
  ```  

### Step 4: Install MySQL agent

Open [MySQL quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/mysql).
Click on install button to start the MySQL agent installation.

### Step 5: Install Apache agent

Open [Apache quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/apache).
Click on install button to start the Apache agent installation.

### Step 6: Configure Wordpress to expose debug logs

Open your Wordpress application and then open `wp-config.php` file
Update the file with the below values as it does log all errors, notices, and warnings to a file called debug.log in the wp-content directory.

  ```
  // Enable WP_DEBUG mode
  define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );

  // Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
  define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
  ```

Once you start your application, you will see a `debug.log` file in wp-content directory.

### Step 7: Forward Wordpress debug logs to New Relic

You can use our [log forwarding](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Wordpress logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in the below path:
```
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```
If you don't see your log file in the above path, then you will need to create a log file by following the above log forwarding documentation.

After creating the log file, add the script below to the `logging.yml` file:

  ```yml
  - name: wordpress-debug.log
    file: /src/www/wordpress/wp-content/debug.log
    attributes:
      logtype: wordpress_debug
  ```

### Step 8: Restart the infrastructure agent

Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

### Step 9: Monitor your application

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Wordpress full stack` to monitor your Wordpress application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template

1. Click on **+ Add data**
2. Click on the Dashboards tab
3. In the search box, type `Wordpress full stack`
4. You should see our pre-build dashboard
5. Click on it to install it on your account

By following these steps, you should see metrics on your dashboard once your application is integrated.

To instrument the Wordpress full stack quickstart and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [Wordpress full stack web quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/wordpress-stack) by clicking on the “Install now” button.

Below is an example query to view the captured metrics on New Relic’s Query Builder.

Example Query: 
Below is the NRQL query to check the first input delay.

  ```sql
  SELECT percentage(count(*), WHERE firstInputDelay < 100) AS 'Good (<100ms)', percentage(count(*), WHERE firstInputDelay >= 100 and firstInputDelay < 300) AS 'Needs improvement (>=100 <300ms)', percentage(count(*), WHERE firstInputDelay >= 300) AS 'Poor (> 300ms)' FROM PageViewTiming WHERE firstInputDelay IS NOT NULL TIMESERIES AUTO
  ```
