Our Wordpress integration monitors the performance of your Wordpress application, helping you diagnose issues in your application and optimize your code. Analyze your performance data (errors, page load time, user traffic, and page views) in view for the best code diagnosis, improvement, and optimization.

### Step 1: Install the relevant agents[#infra-install]

1.  Follow [the infrastructure agent install steps](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/get-started/install-infrastructure-agent) for the host containing your Flutter app.
2. Open [PHP quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/php).
Click on install button to start the PHP agent installation.
3. Open [MySQL quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/mysql).
Click on install button to start the MySQL agent installation.
4. Open [Apache quickstart installation](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/apache).
Click on install button to start the Apache agent installation.

### Step 2: NRI-Flex Configuration

Installing the infrastructure agent will automatically install flex binary. 

To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

1.  Create a file named `read-wordpress-files-config.yml` in this path:

  ```shell
  /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
  ```

2.  Update the `read-wordpress-files-config.yml` with the below details.

    *   INSERT_EVENT_TYPE: You can consider `event_type` as a New Relic database table that you can query using NRQL (for example, WPDirectories).
    *   INSERT_WORDPRESS_PATH: It takes the directory of the WordPress application (for example, /srv/www/wordpress/*).

3.  Use the below configuration file:

  ```
  integrations:
    - name: nri-flex
      interval: 180s
      config:
        name: linuxDirectorySize
        apis:
          - event_type: INSERT_EVENT_TYPE
            commands:
              - run: du INSERT_WORDPRESS_PATH
                split: horizontal
                set_header: [dirSizeKB, dirName]
                regex_match: true
                split_by: (\d+)\s+
  ```  

### Step 3: Configure WordPress to expose debug logs

1. Open your WordPress application and then open `wp-config.php` file
2. Update the file with the below values as it does log all errors, notices, and warnings to a file called debug.log in the wp-content directory.

  ```
  // Enable WP_DEBUG mode
  define( 'WP_DEBUG', true );

  // Enable Debug logging to the /wp-content/debug.log file
  define( 'WP_DEBUG_LOG', true );
  ```

Once you start your application, you will see a `debug.log` file in wp-content directory.

### Step 4: Forward WordPress debug logs to New Relic

You can use our [log forwarding](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward WordPress logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in the below path:
```
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```
If you don't see your log file in the above path, then you will need to create a log file by following the above log forwarding documentation.

After creating the log file, add the script below to the `logging.yml` file:

  ```yml
  - name: wordpress-debug.log
    file: /src/www/wordpress/wp-content/debug.log
    attributes:
      logtype: wordpress_debug
  ```

### Step 5: Restart the infrastructure agent

Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

## Find your data [#find-data]

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `WordPress Full Stack` to monitor your WordPress application metrics. Follow these steps to use our pre-built dashboard template

1. From [one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com), go to the [**Add data** page](https://one.newrelic.com/marketplace). 
2. Click on **Dashboards**.
3. In the search bar, type `WordPress Full Stack`. 
4. The Wordpress dashboard should appear. Click on it to install it.

Wait five minutes and then proceed to finding your data in New Relic. 

Your Wordpress dashboard is considered a custom dashboard and can be found in the **Dashboards** UI. For docs on using and editing dashboards, see [our dashboard docs](/docs/query-your-data/explore-query-data/dashboards/introduction-dashboards).

This integration reports data in the form of our [browser monitoring events](/docs/data-apis/understand-data/event-data/events-reported-browser-monitoring). If you installed the infrastructure agent, you'll also receive [infrastructure data](/docs/infrastructure/manage-your-data/data-instrumentation/default-infrastructure-monitoring-data/#infrastructure-events). 

Here's an example NRQL query to check the delay for first input: 


  ```sql
  SELECT percentage(count(*), 
  WHERE firstInputDelay < 100)
  AS 'Good (<100ms)', percentage(count(*), 
  WHERE firstInputDelay >= 100 and firstInputDelay < 300) 
  AS 'Needs improvement (>=100 <300ms)', percentage(count(*), 
  WHERE firstInputDelay >= 300) 
  AS 'Poor (> 300ms)' 
  FROM PageViewTiming 
  WHERE firstInputDelay IS NOT NULL 
  TIMESERIES AUTO
  ```
