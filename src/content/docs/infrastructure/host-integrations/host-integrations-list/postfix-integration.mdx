Postfix is a free and open-source mail server that routes and delivers electronic mail. With the New Relic infrastructure agent and NRI-Flex, you can quickly instrument and monitor your Postfix mail server.
Postfix monitoring provides important information to help you construct a complete picture of your mail server's performance. This performance data includes message overview, message inserted in and removed from mail queue, email delivery process, and more. Metric data can be seen on our pre-built dashboards, and you can also create your own custom searches, graphs, and alert policies. Our Postfix integration uses a NRI-Flex setup.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your mail server's performance. The version should be 1.10.7 or later to support NRI-Flex integration.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways:

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview).
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/).

## Export Postfix data [#export]

To start the integration process, you need to export your Postfix metrics with pflogsumm. Pflogsumm is a log analyzer for the Postfix and designed to provide an overview of Postfix activity, with just enough detail to give the administrator a "heads up" for potential trouble spots.

Follow the steps below to use pflogsumm.

<CollapserGroup>
  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="export"
    title="Download pflogsumm"
  >
   1. Run the following command to use pflogsumm.
    ```shell
    wget https://jimsun.linxnet.com/downloads/pflogsumm-1.1.3.tar.gz
    ```

   2. Extract the downloaded file.
    ```shell
    tar xvf pflogsumm-1.1.3.tar.gz
    ```

   3. Navigate to the pflogsumm folder and copy the pflogsumm.pl file to the path below.
    ```shell
    /usr/local/bin/pflogsumm
    ```

  </Collapser>

  <Collapser
    className="freq-link"
    id="export"
    title="Run pflogsumm commands to get the Postfix metrics"
  > 

    ```shell
    cat /var/log/mail.log | pflogsumm
    cat /var/log/mail.log | pflogsumm -d today
    ```

  </Collapser>

## NRI-Flex configuration

Once you've installed the infrastructure agent on your host, `nri-flex` binary is also installed with it.
  
If the infrastructure agent was not installed, follow the [installation steps](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/docs/basic-tutorial.md) of `nri-flex` from [nri-flex repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex).

To create a flex configuration file follow these steps:

1. Create a file named `postfix-flex-config.yml` in this path:

  ```shell
  /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
  ```

2. Update the file `postfix-flex-config.yml` with these configurations:
      * `EVENT_TYPE`: You can consider `EVENT_TYPE` as a New Relic database table that you can query using NRQL.
      * `COMMAND`: This contains the command which is used to print metrics on the terminal.

  Once your configuration file is updated, it will look like below:

  ```yml

### Forward your Postfix logs to New Relic
  
You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Postfix logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in the path below. 

```shell
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```

If you don't see your log file, then you will need to create it by following the above log forwarding documentation.

Once the log file is created, add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
  - name: mail.log
    file: /var/log/mail.log
    attributes:
      logtype: postfix_maillog
```
</Step>

<Step>

### Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```
</Step>

<Step>

###  Monitor your application

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Postfix` to monitor your Postfix metrics. 

Steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)** and click on **+ Add data**.
2.  Click on the **Dashboards** tab.
3.  In the search box, type `Postfix`.
4.  When you see our pre-build dashboard, click on it to install it in your account.

Once your application is integrated by following the above steps, the dashboard should display metrics.

To instrument the Postfix quickstart and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [Postfix quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/postfix) that has an **Install now** button.

Here are some example queries:

**Example:** View the latest message records status.
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM PostfixGrandTotals
```

**Example:** View the per-hour message records.
  
```sql
SELECT * FROM PostfixMessagePerHourReport
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## See Postfix metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

With the infrastructure agent installed and nri-flex configuration, you can view your raw data in our Metrics & events. Our default <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> transform that raw data into charts and graphs, which provide a bird's eye view of your system's health.
  
To instrument the Postfix quickstart, install our default dashboards, and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [Postfix quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/postfix) by clicking on the **Install now** button.
