Sendmail is a server application that gives businesses a way to send email using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Using New Relic infrastructure agent and NRI-Flex configuration, you can quickly instrument and monitor your server.

## Install the infrastructure agent [#infra]

To get data into New Relic, install our infrastructure agent. Our infrastructure agent collects and ingests data so you can keep track of your mail serverâ€™s performance.

You can install the infrastructure agent two different ways: 

* Our [guided install](https://one.newrelic.com/nr1-core?state=4f81feab-35f7-e97e-9903-52510f8542bd) is a CLI tool that inspects your system and installs the infrastructure agent alongside the application monitoring agent that best works for your system. To learn more about how our guided install works, check out our [Guided install overview](/docs/infrastructure/host-integrations/installation/new-relic-guided-install-overview). 
* If you'd rather install our infrastructure agent manually, you can follow a tutorial for manual installation for [Linux](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/linux-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-linux), [Windows](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/windows-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-windows/), or [macOS](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/macos-installation/install-infrastructure-monitoring-agent-macos/).

## NRI-Flex configuration

Once you've installed the infrastructure agent on your host, `nri-flex` binary is also installed with it.

If the infrastructure agent was not installed, follow the [installation steps](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex/blob/master/docs/basic-tutorial.md) of `nri-flex` from [nri-flex repository](https://github.com/newrelic/nri-flex).

Follow below steps to create a flex configuration file:

1. Create a file named `sendmail-flex-config.yml` in this path:

  ```shell
  /etc/newrelic-infra/integrations.d
  ```

2. Update the file `sendmail-flex-config.yml` with these configurations:
      * `EVENT_TYPE`: You can consider `EVENT_TYPE` as a New Relic database table that you can query using NRQL.
      * `COMMAND`: This contains the command which is used to print metrics on the terminal.

Once your configuration file is updated, it will look like below:

  ```yml

### Forward your Sendmail logs to New Relic 

You can use our [log forwarding](/docs/logs/forward-logs/forward-your-logs-using-infrastructure-agent/) to forward Sendmail logs to New Relic.

On Linux machines, your log file named `logging.yml` should be present in the path below. 

```shell
/etc/newrelic-infra/logging.d/
```

If you don't see your log file, then you will need to create it by following the above log forwarding documentation.

Once the log file is created, add the following script to the `logging.yml` file:

```yml
  
  - name: mail.log
    file: /var/log/mail.log
    attributes:
      logtype: sendmail_log
  - name: mail.err
    file: /var/log/mail.err
    attributes:
      logtype: sendmail_error
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Restart the New Relic infrastructure agent

Before you can start reading your data, use the instructions in our [infrastructure agent docs](/docs/infrastructure/install-infrastructure-agent/manage-your-agent/start-stop-restart-infrastructure-agent/) to restart your infrastructure agent.

```shell
sudo systemctl restart newrelic-infra.service
```
</Step>

<Step>

###  Monitor your application

You can choose our pre-built dashboard template named `Sendmail` to monitor your Sendmail metrics. 

Steps to use our pre-built dashboard template:

1. Go to **[one.newrelic.com](https://one.newrelic.com/)** and click on **+ Add data**.
2.  Click on the **Dashboards** tab.
3.  In the search box, type `Sendmail`.
4.  When you see our pre-build dashboard, click on it to install it in your account.

Once your application is integrated by following the above steps, the dashboard should display metrics.

To instrument the Sendmail quickstart and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [Sendmail quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/sendmail) that has an **Install now** button.

 Here are some example queries:

**Example:** View the latest message sent status.

```sql
SELECT latest(sent) as 'Sent', latest(deferred) as â€˜Deferredâ€™ FROM SendmailMessageStatus
```

**Example:** View the Sendmail service status.

```sql
SELECT latest(value) as 'Service Up' FROM SendmailUp TIMESERIES AUTO
```

</Step>

</Steps>

## See Sendmail metrics in a dashboard [#dash]

With the infrastructure agent installed and nri-flex configuration, you can view your raw data in our Metrics & events. Our default <InlinePopover type="dashboards" /> transform that raw data into charts and graphs, which provide a bird's eye view of your system's health.

To instrument the Sendmail quickstart, install our default dashboards, and to see metrics and alerts, you can also follow our [Sendmail quickstart page](https://newrelic.com/instant-observability/sendmail) by clicking on the **Install now** button.
